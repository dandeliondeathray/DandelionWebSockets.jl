# DandelionWebSockets
DandelionWebSockets is a client side WebSocket package.

## Usage
Create a subtype of `WebSocketHandler`, with callbacks for WebSocket events. Create a `WSClient` and
connect to a WebSocket server.

```julia
import DandelionWebSockets: on_text, on_binary
import DandelionWebSockets: state_connecting, state_open,
                            state_closing, state_closed

mutable struct MyHandler <: WebSocketHandler
    client::WSClient
end

# These are called when you get a text or binary frame, respectively.
on_text(handler::MyHandler, text::String) = ...
on_binary(handler::MyHandler, data::Vector{UInt8}) = ...

# These are called when the state of the WebSocket changes.
state_connecting(handler::MyHandler) = ...
state_open(handler::MyHandler)       = ...
state_closing(handler::MyHandler)    = ...
state_closed(handler::MyHandler)     = ...
```

The following functions are available on `WSClient`, to send frames to the server.

```
send_text(c::WSClient, s::String)
send_binary(c::WSClient, data::Vector{UInt8})

# Close the WebSocket.
stop(c::WSClient)
```

To connect to a WebSocket server, call
`wsconnect(client::WSClient, uri::URI, handler::WebSocketHandler)`.

For the full example code, please check out `examples/echo.jl`.

## Needs work

- Implement regular pings, to ensure the connection is up.
- Wait for Requests.jl next release.
  This package needs a HTTP Upgrade feature of Requests.jl, which is only present in master, not in
  the release 0.3.7.
- Ability to send multi-frame messages.
